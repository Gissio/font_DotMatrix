# DotMatrix

**DotMatrix** is a font inspired by the dot matrix printers of the 1980s, capturing the essence of the printing technologies from that era. It is ideal for evoking a retro or nostalgic feel, rendering ASCII/ANSI art, or use in code editors. For true scale, use **10 point text**.

This font includes:

* 537 characters, including the full set from the Epson FX-80 printer, DOS code page 437, Google Fonts Latin Core, Greek Core, Cyrillic Core, and Hebrew.

* Comprehensive modes of the Epson FX-80 printer, mapped as follows:
  
  |Epson FX-80 Mode|DotMatrix Font Family|
  |------------|---|
  |Pica|DotMatrix|
  |Elite|DotMatrix Expanded|
  |Compressed|DotMatrix Condensed|
  |Expanded Pica|DotMatrix Double|
  |Expanded Elite|DotMatrix Double Expanded|
  |Expanded Compressed|DotMatrix Double Condensed|
  |Emphasized Pica| DotMatrix Double UltraCondensed|
  |Emphasized Expanded Pica|DotMatrix Quad|

* **"Double-strike"** is represented by the Bold style.
* **"Italic"** corresponds to the Italic style.
* **"Proportional mode"** is mapped to the respective Var font families.

Additionally, **DotMatrix** includes two variable axes:

* **Element Size**: Adjusts the dot strength.
